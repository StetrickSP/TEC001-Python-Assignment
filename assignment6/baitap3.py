# Write a program that asks the user to enter names until they enter an empty string. After each name is read, the program either prints out New name or Existing name depending on whether the name was entered for the first time. Finally, the program lists out the input names one by one, one below another in any order. Use the set data structure to store the names.

names = []

while True:
    name = input("Enter a name (or press Enter to quit): ")

    if name == "":
        break

    if name in names:
        print("Existing name")
    else:
        print("New name")
        names.append(name)

print("\nNames entered:")
for name in names:
    print(name)
